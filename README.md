# 🎵 MUSIC NATION CODE 🎵

Welcome to Music Nation Code, a fantastic application that allows you to listen to full songs without any annoying adverts. Our project combines the best of frontend technologies with React and Material UI, while the backend is powered by Node.js. The efficient streaming of songs is facilitated through an Express server that dynamically fetches songs from YouTube as per the user's demands.
